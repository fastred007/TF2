alias startspam "say Traps are NOT gay and I am here to prove it. ; wait 300; spam1;"
alias spam1 "say Let's start with logic thinking. We will apply these questions to a trap, and it will help determine if they are gay. ; wait 300; spam2;"
alias spam2 "say Does the person have a masculine penis? No, they have a feminine penis. ; wait 300; spam3;"
alias spam3 "say Is the person a man? No, they are called dickgirls for a reason. ; wait 300; spam4;"
alias spam4 "say Does a man have a numerical value of 1? No, not only is that not the case, but a man (or a woman) has no numerical value. ; wait 300; spam5;"
alias spam5 "say This is nonsense. Is it gay to be fucked by a girl? No, if this was the case then all heterosexual sex would in fact be homosexual in nature.; wait 300; spam6;"
alias spam6 "say Suffice to say, I think we can all agree that traps are not gay using quick and easy logic thinking. ; wait 300; spam7;"
alias spam7 "say Now, we will use imagination thinking to imagine a situation in which you are having sexual intercourse with a trap. ; wait 300; spam8;"
alias spam8 "say Ok, so like imagine this chick; but she's this totally fucking SMOKING hot chick; wait 300; spam9;"
alias spam9 "say and she's got really sexy titties and a sexy butthole that you can pound and a sexy little feminine penis you can stroke and suck. ; wait 300; spam10;"
alias spam10 "say Did that feel gay? I thought not. We have used both of the types of thinking to solve the mystery of if traps are gay.; wait 300; spam11;"
alias spam11 "say They are not. I have used indisputable science techniques to skip the hypothesis completely and go straight to a proof. ; wait 300; spam12;"
alias spam12 "say Science thinking is a secret third type of thinking that many people don't have so this may be a difficult concept to grasp for some. ; wait 300; spam13;"
alias spam13 "say I am happy to explain my theorem further and am opening this thread to discussion."
